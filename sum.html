        <summary>1. What is CSS? Why do we use it?</summary>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for styling and to describe the presentation (layout, colors, fonts) of HTML documents.</p>
    </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>2. In how many ways can we create CSS styling?</summary>
            <p>CSS styling can be added in three main ways:
                Inline CSS: Styles are added directly to the HTML element using the style attribute.
                Internal (Embedded) CSS: Styles are placed inside  tag within the HTML document head tag
                External CSS Styles are placed in an external .css file, linked to the HTML file.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>3.Difference between the 3 ways of CSS styling:</summary>
            <p>Inline CSS: Overrides all other styles but can make HTML harder to maintain.
                Internal CSS: Good for small websites or pages with unique styles but doesn’t allow for reusability across pages.
                External CSS: Best for larger projects, allows separation of concerns and reusability across multiple pages</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>4. What is specificity among the ways of CSS styling?</summary>
            <p>Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied by calculating the "weight" of selectors. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by ID selectors, class selectors, and element selectors.</p>
